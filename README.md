## Remote Work Agent Based Model 
This project is the initial starting point for an agent based simulation to study the effects of remote work to interactions
between workers in a company 

##Basic model
the basic model is a replica of the one found in 
Clement, J., & Puranam, P. (2018). Searching for Structure: Formal Organization Design as a Guide to Network Evolution. Management Science, 64(8), 3879â€“3895. https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2807

## Installation 
``` bash
pipenv install 
```

## Usage 
``` bash 
pipenv shell 
jupyter lab
```

Once open use the `run.ipynb` file to execute the model 

you can also run `main.py`, but it is not suggested 

## test 
```bash 
python -m unittest discover
```

## Does
Creates a simulation based of the paper in basic model
